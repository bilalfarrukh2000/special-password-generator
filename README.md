# special-password-generator
I have created an application that can allow the user to generate a random password. I have also cleaned and plished the interface in a way that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. The end result privides a strong password to add greater security to the user. The password can range from 8 to 128 charcters. The password will also have the ability to use special charcters as well as numbers. The password will also give the user further specifications such as electing to use an upper case letter and/or lower case letter.
